🚀 **Projects I'm working on!**  
- 🧠 Exploring **AI & NLP** (currently interested in Decision Transformers & attention-based models)  
- 🛠️ A solution for long term memory storage for LLMs like ChatGPT

📚 **What I'm Learning!**  
- 🧵 **Tatting lace** : Crocheting and handmaking lace by hand is a very fascinating way I have found to conceptualize how tensors work! 
- 🐦 **Bird migration patterns**: I'm trying to understand how many different agents can work together in a group to meet their end goal!
- ❓**Epistemic Logic**: I am trying to understand how two agents can communicate a certain idea to each other
- 🤝 **Multi-Agentic Reinforcement Learning**: This is a more formalized way I am trying to explore the intersection betwen AI/ML and 
- 🤖 The **Decision Transformer Model**: I'm very interested in how different models can come to a decision together
