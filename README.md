# 👩🏽‍💻 A couple of my ongoing projects! 👩🏽‍💻
## Front Burner
- **Colab Lux**  
  A Chrome/Colab workflow tool for auto-generating lightweight docs (timestamp + summary) and pushing updates to Git (e.g., via Gist), with optional “refactor/ticket” prompts.
    - Chrome/Colab-integrated workflow tool -  for documenting work as it happens
    - **Auto-generates lightweight documentation** (timestamps, short summaries, code context)
    - **Pushes documentation directly to GitHub** (e.g., via Gists) to create a traceable dev history
    - Designed to **minimize context-switching** between coding, thinking, and writing 
    - Exploring **minimal ticketing** and refactor prompts to track iteration effort without heavy PM tools

- **SituatiONION (Transformer Architecture + Mid-Layers Visualization)**  
  A layerwise study of GPT-2 XL focusing on how representations evolve across depth, with clean visualizations of mid-layer “situation modeling” and layer-to-layer dynamics.
  - Layerwise analysis of transformer models (focused on GPT-2 XL)
  - Treats early, mid, and late layers as functionally distinct regimes
  - Focuses on mid-layers where higher-level abstractions and relational structure emerge
  - Builds clean visualizations of representation flow across layers
  - Frames internal model behavior geometrically (manifold / flow-based) rather than token-only
  - Aims to make transformer internals legible to humans, not just measurable via probe

## About Me
- I study how decisions are made—by people and by machines.
- I’m interested in the structure behind good outcomes, not just the outcomes themselves.
- Transformer models gave me a concrete way to examine decision-making from an external, inspectable system.
- My work focuses on internal representations, mid-layer reasoning, and interpretability.
- I’ve spent the past several months analyzing GPT-2 XL to understand how meaning emerges and stabilizes across layers.
