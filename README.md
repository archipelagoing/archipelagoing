# hello, i'm archisa!
Thanks for showing interest in me and my work!
I'm a passionate Masters in Computer Science candidate at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, learning about AI every day :)

What I'm working towards:
I've spent a long, long time wondering how people go about making decisions. 
There is a process to making good decisions, and while you can control how you feel about the decisions you make, some outcomes are more desirable than others. 
Learning about Artificial Intelligence and the transformer architecture gave me the incredible opportunity to explore this process through an external lens. 
I have spent the last couple months scouring the architecture of GPT2xl to figure out how the different layers of the transformer model encodes meaning out of its input
